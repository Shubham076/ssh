### SSH
The SSH connection process can be broken down into the following steps:  
  
- **Key exchange**: The client and server perform a key exchange, often using the Diffie-Hellman algorithm, to establish a shared secret key. This process involves both parties generating a pair of public and private keys, exchanging their public keys, and then using their private keys along with the received public keys to generate the shared secret.  
  
- **Server authentication**: After the key exchange, the client verifies the server's identity using its public key to prevent "man-in-the-middle" attacks. If the server's public key is not in the client's known_hosts file, the client will prompt the user to decide whether to trust the key and continue with the connection.  
  
- **User authentication** : Once the server is authenticated, the client must prove its identity to the server using one of several available methods, such as password-based authentication or public key authentication.  
  
 - **(User authentication)Public key authentication**: In this case, the client generates a pair of public and private keys. The public key is added to the server's authorized_keys file, which is usually located at ~/.ssh/authorized_keys. The private key remains on the client machine. During authentication, the client signs a message using its private key, and the server verifies the signature with the client's public key stored in the authorized_keys file.  
  
- **Secure session**: After successful authentication, a secure session is established between the client and server using the shared secret key derived during the key exchange process.  
  
  
#### Signing a message process:  
Here's a high-level overview of the process:  
  
**The client generates a message**: In an SSH connection, the client creates a message that will be signed. This message usually contains a unique piece of data, such as a random number or a timestamp, to ensure that the signature is unique for each authentication attempt.  
  
**Signing the message**: The client uses its private key to generate a digital signature for the message. This process typically involves applying a cryptographic hash function to the message and then encrypting the hash using the client's private key. The resulting digital signature is unique to the message and can only be generated by someone who has the private key.  
  
**Sending the message and signature**: The client sends the message and the digital signature to the server over the secure channel established during the key exchange.  
  
**Verification by the server**: The server uses the client's public key (stored in the authorized_keys file) to verify the digital signature. This process involves decrypting the signature using the public key and comparing the resulting hash with the hash of the received message. If the hashes match, the server can be confident that the message was signed by the client's private key and that the message was not tampered with during transmission.
